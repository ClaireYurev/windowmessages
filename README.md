# A list of window messages for Windows.

Since MSDN doesn't provide a comprehensive list of Windows Messages, we can refer to multiple sources that collectively provide extensive information, such as:
WineHQ Wiki with its extensive list of Windows messages with both hexadecimal and decimal values, which includes many system messages not found in standard MSDN documentation?.
Various GitHub repositories that provide lists of windows messages and helper functions that return a message name by its identifier.
